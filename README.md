> The current repository is part of a personal project. The main goal is to solve all app ideas from [florinpop17/app-ideas](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas) repo.

This repo contains a challenge proposed by [florinpop17/app-ideas](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas). The cause-effect app goal is to click an item on a list and display its details. See all challenge details [here](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/Cause-Effect-App.md).

The challenge limitations are that you must use only HTML, CSS, and Javascript without any libraries to do DOM manipulation. Based on it, this project was created only using Typescript and Rollup to build the final JS file.

The application will load a hardcoded Javascript object which includes data of 10 people. This data was random generated by mockaroo, and avatars are AI computed generated. Three classes were developed to control each part of the DOM elements envolved in application.
